<p>05_SEPTEMBER_2022: 02_SEPTEMBER_2022: If money was no longer an object for all people to have to be concerned with (that is, everyone was given exactly as much money as they each wanted and people were not allowed to purchase military grade weapons because the military would exist as its own parallel economy), I think that, if everyone knew how good it feels to be alone, most people would turn into self indulgent introverts (and entire communities and cultural trends would emerge from such an uprising). I imagine a world where people can, without having to ask for permission, could &#8220;disappear&#8221; for four days at a time to stay indoors or to go wherever they want and not have to report to anyone about what they do while a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/technocratic_utopia_copy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technocratic surveillance and minimally interventionist Internet of Things</a> stealthily monitors all human activities. The surveillance net world not let anyone get away with committing serious crimes. Hence, there would hardly be a need for humans to be employed as law enforcement personnel (since robots would do the bulk of essential and dangerous labor) and the jail system would likely be replaced by a mental health facility (because all criminals would be treated as people with unmet basic needs who are having difficulties and need assistance so that they can become non-harmful and minimally healthy citizens).</p>
<p>I sat in my childhood backyard looking up at the roof my little friends and I used to throw balls over. As I sat there in the dirt where the lawn used to be, I commented to myself about how, like I was at the nearby cow pasture, I was sitting where I used to live as a child from more than two decades ago. Then I thought about how much I feel like a different person than who I apparently have memories of being two decades ago. So I said, &#8220;The person who used to inhabit the body I am currently inhabiting used to live here two decades ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I thought about how it is possible that each one of the billions of cells which comprise what I call &#8220;my (human) body&#8221; has likely been replaced such that not a single cell from two decades ago is still alive in this body. If that is true, then neither the body nor the mind which appeared to be Karlina Ray Beringer from two decades ago remains because both have died and been replaced. Interesting stuff to think about!</p>
