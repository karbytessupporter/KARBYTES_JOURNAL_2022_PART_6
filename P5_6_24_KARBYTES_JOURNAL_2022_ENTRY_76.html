<p>04_SEPTEMBER_2022: After contemplating the matter one more time, I decided that the path of least suffering for me would be to return the Toyota Matrix to my parents tonight and rely on public transportation, walking, and bicycling for 100% of my commutes to and from work and wherever I decide to do my own school for one. Lately I have been experiencing success with using various parking garages in Dublin/Pleasanton and the gardens between corporate buildings to use my laptop for hours at a time. There is free Wi-Fi in various locations in case I run out of money to pay for my AT&amp;T service or if I lose my phone. There is also free electricity to charge my laptop computer and phone at some of the shopping centers and parking garages in Dublin/Pleasanton. Today I was able to change my tentative work shift at Amazon warehouse in Newark (i.e. OAK5) from night shift to day shift (and the schedule I selected gives me time to schedule doctor appointments and other errands during the weekdays). I do not mind having to camp in the parks nearby the OAK5 facilities until I am able to afford a bicycle. I am &#8220;desperate&#8221; enough to do whatever it takes to get to work on time and to not rely on someone else&#8217;s car to get there (if my background check is approved and I am consequently offered the job). Otherwise, I will &#8220;casually&#8221; look for other jobs which I can commute to via public transportation, walking, and bicycling. (Not having to drive feels like a modern super power to wield; the ability to be my own vehicle and avoid the many costs of driving my own car or some car which I am borrowing; the ability to feel that I am honestly minimizing my harmful ecological impact and not just saying I will get around to that one day in the future which might never come).</p>
