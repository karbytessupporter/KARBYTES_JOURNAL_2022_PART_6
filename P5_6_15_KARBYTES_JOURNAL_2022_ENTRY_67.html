<p>02_SEPTEMBER_2022: The police (or whoever that was who sent me a message via what I think is some technology akin to microwave auditory effect) said, &#8220;You are a burden to the police,&#8221; and that the police just want me to be bullied into self imprisonment; secluded in an indoor location where I am neither seen nor heard by other people (and that they want me to stay indoors at my parents&#8217; houses without a job because I am deserve to exclusively financially dependent on my parents so that I am not a burden to anyone besides my parents and so that I am available to be ridiculed and otherwise tortured by the police.</p>
<p>One way I have been tortured by what I think are the police is being spammed with psychotronic harassment messages about how I need to get a job and that I need to go to school but, as soon as I seriously make moves towards doing any of those two things, the police harass me with discouraging and distracting messages and insinuate that I am being held back from doing what would give me self esteem and a sense that I am not being treated worse than the average United States citizen.</p>
<p>However I ended up in this predicament is something to discuss. What I would rather call attention to now is that I have arguably been stalking and ridiculing the police just for being unemployed and not in a desperate crazed rush to find paid employment the way I used to be. <span style="background:#ffff00;">The police are not my friends (and they seem to be doing more harm in the world than good as far as I can discern). When there is not enough &#8220;real&#8221; criminal activity to keep the police busy, I think that the police (or whoever these intrusive psychotronic harassment mongers are) are hellbent on isolating, torturing, and brainwashing me into thinking and behaving how they want me to; someone who is not quite as happy, confident, relaxed, smart, invigorated, attentive, clear-headed, and imaginative as I presume I am without &#8220;corrupting&#8221; influences from what I call &#8220;the matrix&#8221; (and I see &#8220;the matrix&#8221; as a pervasive and dogmatic mind control enterprise which subliminally and overtly coerces humans into thinking and behaving in ways which suit the agenda of &#8220;the matrix&#8221;; especially the imperative for each person to have insufficient free time to be as autonomous, smart, and healthy as I think they otherwise could be (and an effective way to keep people from having that vital free time is bombarding them with sexist messages about how they need to have kids to take care of in order to qualify for certain kinds of economic benefits, social protections, and, perhaps most importantly, the &#8220;right&#8221; to incessantly boast about how one is too busy taking care of its Family to be accused of being as &#8220;narcissistic&#8221; as I am (which means that the Family devotees &#8220;deserve&#8221; to be spared the kinds of cruelty I am routinely subject to))).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">Anyway, I intend to keep fighting the tyrants in my life and do my best to not let anything impede me from doing what I want to do.</span></p>

<p>As soon as I attempted to back the web page source code of this web page to my GitHub account, the Wi-Fi at my mother&#8217;s house suddenly stopped working. When I turned my computer off and back on, my laptop was able to access that Wi-Fi network but not use it to access any websites. To make this update, I am using my AT&amp;T mobile phone data to establish an Internet connection. I suppose I should thank the tyrants for forcing me to not get too comfortable. <span style="background:#00ff00;">Perhaps the tyrants want me to get a job which requires me to drive or else spend hours walking to so that I cannot significantly improve the chances that my next paid job will be an office job making a lot more money per hour than what I would have to accept at some menial labor job like warehousing and low-end customer service.</span></p>

<p>After unplugging the router from the wall outlet and unplugging the Ethernet cable and then reconnecting the Ethernet cable and plugging the router back into the wall outlet again such that the router was reset, I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi at my mother&#8217;s house via my laptop computer. I suspect that a hacker was given legal permission to disrupt my Internet connection (perhaps in order to see whether or not I would attempt to reset the router).</p>

<p>Based on all the knowledge which I currently have access to, I think it is in everyone&#8217;s best interest for me to act as though the police are more like enemies than they are like allies to me (so that other people do not think I am getting special advantages from being in constant &#8220;telepathic&#8221; communication with the police). In all honesty, I think that the police intervention has helped me in some ways but it has also been crippling in other ways. <span style="background:#00ff00;">I am inclined to default to always saying that the police intervention in my life has been more helpful to me than harmful to me.</span> I believe the police have more power than I do in terms of controlling my use of technology. I also believe that the police (or military or whatever) has the power to remote experience my &#8220;first person&#8221; subjective reality and to override my cognition, perception, movements, and organ functions using remote interference (because I have caught glimpses of such interventionism before). For instance, I remember wondering a few years ago whether or not the government had the power to shut off my sight and I saw what looked like a cage-like lattice superimposed over my visual field for about one second. I also remember &#8220;the voices&#8221; saying something about how they can make me see and do whatever they want. I believe that mind control technologies are far more advanced than what they general public is &#8220;allowed&#8221; to know because, if too many people knew about such mind control technologies, they would likely either go insane or try to start a political revolution about the people having the right to know what is really going on behind the scenes of their otherwise mundane reality. I believe it is very easy for any person to be rendered insane and/or criminal just by subjecting them to the right kinds of covert psychotronic interference. Being able to merely talk about such matters publicly on the Internet is a monumental battle in itself. I see how my most modern websites are not making it to the top of search engine results when I type in my name. I do have hope that, eventually, the websites I most want to showcase to the general public will garner more traffic. For the time being, I get the sense that I live in a place where people are chronically angry at me but do not want to talk to me directly about what is bothering me and that such people want me to feel that I am being socially ostracized, ignored, belittled, and tortured to the extent that I feel that I have no one but the police to call my friends (because they seem to be the only people interested in following what I have to say on the Internet).</p>
