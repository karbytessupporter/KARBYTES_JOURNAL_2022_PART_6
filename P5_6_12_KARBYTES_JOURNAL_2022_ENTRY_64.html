<p>01_SEPTEMBER_2022: I parked the petroleum powered minivan which my parents have allowed me to borrow at that special side street I used to leave that car parked at for weeks at a time during the past three years. I did that because other people routinely park their cars in front of &#8220;my&#8221; car whenever I park that car at my mom&#8217;s house in its &#8220;designated&#8221; spot. (Usually, my dad parks his car right in front of &#8220;mine&#8221;. Also, if either my mom or dad sees the car parked within &#8220;line of sight&#8221; of my mom&#8217;s house, they move &#8220;my&#8221; car back to its &#8220;designated&#8221; location. To prevent my parents from moving that car or else blocking it, I moved it to that special parking spot. Also, keeping it in a relatively inconvenient yet what seems to be a reasonably safe location makes me less tempted to use the car and to, hence, burn gasoline and put wear and tear on the vehicle).</p>
<p>I may or may not use the car for work and hauling stuff in the future. Perhaps I will &#8220;see the light&#8221; (again) and move the car back to its &#8220;designated&#8221; location at my mom&#8217;s house. Perhaps I will keep the car parked in its special side street location so that, to some, it looks as though I am at work (or some other &#8220;appropriate&#8221; location) and not just chilling at home.</p>
